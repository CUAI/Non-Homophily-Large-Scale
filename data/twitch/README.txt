Twitch Social Networks


These datasets used for node classification and transfer learning are Twitch user-user networks of gamers who stream in a certain language. Nodes are the users themselves and the links are mutual friendships between them. Vertex features are extracted based on the games played and liked, location and streaming habits. Datasets share the same set of node features, this makes transfer learning across networks possible. These social networks were collected in May 2018. The supervised task related to these networks is binary node classification - one has to predict whether a streamer uses explicit language.
